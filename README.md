# Hacker Experience IP Checker
HE IP Checker is a little userscript that checks IP addresses for their types and if they exist. It injects into the breadcrumb bar, and the input window opens when you click the link the 'Check IP's' link just beneath where your bank money is shown.

## Installation
1. Make sure you got a userscript manager installed. I recommend [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/).
2. Click [here](https://github.com/jmerle/hacker-experience-ip-checker/raw/master/he-ip-checker.user.js) and click Install in the tab that opens.
3. Done! Updates will be installed automatically. When you don't change Tampermonkey's default settings, it checks for updates daily.
